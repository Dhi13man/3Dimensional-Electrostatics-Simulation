# 3Dimensional-Electrostatics-Simulation
This is a MATLAB program to simulate Electrostatic phenomenon, particularly Coulomb's Law. We maintain a simulated 'Charge space', assumed to be an infinite homogenous insulating medium. The assumption is that every charged body in it remains stationary.

----
# Simulation Properties:
1. Let `charge_space` be a Structure Array  with `x_coord`, `y_coord`, `z_coord` coordinates and `mag` magnitude as properties of the Structure, representing the simulated medium obeying the necessary assumptions of Coulombâ€™s Law.
2. Then, `length(charged_space)` gives the number of Charged particles in charge_space.
3. Let `charge_space_permittivity` represents the permittivity of the medium.

# Functions and Usage:

USAGE: Client Functions that wrap the Back-end Functions
--
A. The `plot_space()` client function **plots the entirety of the charge_space and all the charges present in it in 3 Dimensional Space as a Scatter plot**. 

B. The `menu()` client function creates the **"Charge Space Menu"** and can be called to 
1. **Add charged bodies** into `charge_space`. Positive Charges are Red and Negative are Blue.
2. **Remove charged bodies** from `charge_space`. Or 7. **Clear entirety** of the `charge_space`.
3. **Generate N random charged bodies** in `charge_space`.
4. **Display information** i.e. Location and Magnitude of any charged body.
5. **Plot the charge_space** as a 3-Dimensional scatter plot.
6. **Exit** out of **Charge Space Menu**.

C. The `calc()` client function creates the **"Calculate Values with Coulomb's Law Menu"** and can be called to
1. **Change permittivity**, i.e `charge_space_permittivity` of `charge_space`.
2. **Calculate net force on any charge** in `charge_space`.
3. **Calculate force between any two temporary charges** defined by parameters.
4 **Calculate force between any two charges** in `charge_space`.
5. **Calculate net Electric Field strength** in any point in `charge_space`.
6. **Exit** out of **Calculate Values with Coulomb's Law Menu**.

D. The `plot_graphs()` client function can be used to **graphically test the relationship of the parameters with the force**.

Back-end Functions:
--
A. Charge Space Manipulation
1. `clear_charge_space()`: Removes all charges from Charge Space.
2. `charge_place()`: Creates a charge at coordinates pointed by parameters `x, y, z` in charge space of magnitude given by parameter `mag` and plots it if parameter `show` is 1 or [].
3. `display_charge`: Display location and magnitude of charge given by parameter `obj` in charge space. `obj` can be numeric or Structure.
4. `charge_destroy`: Removes charge given by parameter `obj` from charge space. `obj` can be numeric or Structure.
5. `n_random_charges`: Generate number of random charges as given by parameter `number`.

B. Locating Charges
1. `get_chargenum_bycoord`: Get the number of the Charge pointed by given coordinate parameters `x, y, z` in charge_space.
2. `get_charge_bynum`: Get Charge object pointed by parameter `charge_number` in charge_space. 

C. Finding physical Force and Electric Field Strength values
1. `charge_pair_force`: Calculates the three Dimensional components of force on charge parameter `obj` by charge parameter `obj2`.
2. `charge_net_force`: Superposition Theorem: Calculates the three dimensional components of the net force on charge parameter `obj` by all other Charges.
3. `net_field_at`: Superposition Theorem: Calculates the three dimensional components of the net Electric Field strength at coordinate parameters `x, y, z` in Charge Space.
